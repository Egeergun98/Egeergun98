I have completed courses that lay the foundations of computer science and software technologies such as Software Architecture, Software Testing and Validation, Software Specification and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics and Programming for Computer Science. Graduated with a GPA of 2.73. Although I didn't have much work experience, I was very active at university. I tried to develop innovative solutions on various software platforms in school projects. In my graduation project, I led the development of an e-commerce system.
